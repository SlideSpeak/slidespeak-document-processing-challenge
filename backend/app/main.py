Main application module for the AI Document Analyzer API

# You'll need to implement the following endpoints:

# 1. Document upload endpoint
# POST /api/documents
# This should accept a file upload and start processing it

# 2. Document status endpoint
# GET /api/documents/{document_id}
# This should return the current status of a document

# 3. WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates
# WebSocket /ws/documents/{document_id}
# This should provide real-time progress updates

# Additional considerations:
# - How will you handle concurrent document processing?
# - How will you manage task prioritization?
# - How will you implement retries for failed operations?
# - How will you ensure the system remains responsive under load?
